# Squishy: The SCSI Multitool

Squishy is a platform for working with old SCSI devices with modern systems in a flexible manner. It was originally developed as a one-off solution for the [taperipper](https://lethalbit.net/projects/taperipper/) project, which was to boot a modern system off of a IBM 9348-002 9-track magnetic tape drive.

It has since evolved into being a generic toolkit and hardware platform for all things SCSI.

Squishy is comprised of 4 core components; A gateware library built on [Amaranth](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth); A python library with various utilities and structures for dealing with SCSI data; A applet system to allow for custom gateware/python code applets to run on the hardware; And finally, the hardware itself.
