# Squishy: The SCSI Multitool

Squishy is a platform for working with old SCSI devices with modern systems in a flexible manner. It was originally developed as a one-off solution for the [taperipper](https://lethalbit.net/projects/taperipper/) project, which was to boot a modern system off of a IBM 9348-002 9-track magnetic tape drive.

It has since evolved into being a generic toolkit and hardware platform for all things SCSI.

Squishy is comprised of 4 core components; A gateware library built on [Torii](https://github.com/shrine-maiden-heavy-industries/torii-hdl); A python library with various utilities and structures for dealing with SCSI data; A applet system to allow for custom gateware/python code applets to run on the hardware; And finally, the hardware itself.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're looking for the Squishy hardware, the design files have moved to [`squishy-scsi/hardware`](https://github.com/squishy-scsi/hardware).

More information about Sachi is available on her [mascot page](https://docs.scsi.moe/mascot.html) in the documentation.

Sachi was designed and illustrated by the amazing [Tyson Tan (tysontan.com)](https://tysontan.com). He provides mascot design service for free and open source software projects, free of charge, under free license.
