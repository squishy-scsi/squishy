This is the documentation for [Squishy] and its supporting components, as well as a collection of guides and tutorials for the Squishy ecosystem.


## What Squishy Isn't

It's important to detail what Squishy isn't, as it differs a lot from other devices intended to interact with older SCSI systems.

Squishy is not *only* a disk emulator like the [BlueSCSI] or the [SCSI2SD]. It is also not *only* a SCSI to USB Mass storage adapter.

Squishy is not a *specialized* device targeting only a single aspect of the SCSI ecosystem, nor targeting only a single platform.

## What Squishy Is

Squishy is a platform, it allows you to accomplish almost any goal you wish to that involves a SCSI bus. It can do things as mundane as emulating a SCSI hard drive, but also you can use it to [sniff, analyze, and replay SCSI bus traffic], or even boot a modern system from 9-track tape.

You can think of Squishy as being "Software Defined SCSI", much like how a Software Defined Radio works with a hardware transceiver and a software ecosystem, Squishy provides the same, but for SCSI.

It is comprised of a [gateware] and [python] library as well as a [hardware] platform that acts as a bridge between the software and SCSI bus. Squishy allows for powerful and flexible control over all things SCSI, and using its [powerful applet system] it gives that power to you.


For a more detailed introduction to Squishy and it's components, see the [Introduction] section of the documentation. Then, when you're ready visit the [Getting Started] section to get up an running.

Squishy is entirely open source, and under permissive licenses. The full source code, gateware, firmware, and hardware designs are available on [GitHub].

<small>**1:** Only supports DaynaPORT emulation.</small>

<small>**2:** PiSCSI allows you to write Linux userspace software via an API.</small>

<small>**3:** The adapter board is Open Source, but the main compute element is not.</small>

<small>**4:** Depends on the SCSI PHY Module and interface adapter.</small>

<small>**5:** Only ULTRA320 SCSI speeds are guaranteed, however, depending on the silicon lottery ULTRA640 may be achievable.</small>

<small>**6:** Squishy requires USB power for operation, therefore it is considered to always be tethered.</small>

<small>**7:** Due to the hardware not being 100% complete an accurate cost is not available yet.</small>

<small>**8:** This includes only the PiSCSI interface itself, and not the needed RaspberryPi SOM as well.</small>


## Community

Squishy has a dedicated IRC channel, [#squishy on libera.chat]. Join to ask questions, discuss ongoing development, or just hang out.

There are also [GitHub Discussions] enabled on the repository if you have any questions or comments.
