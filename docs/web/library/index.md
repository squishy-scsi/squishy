Squishy, along with being a standalone tool, is also an Amaranth HDL gateware library for interacting with SCSI, as well as a Python library for dealing with SCSI packets.

The [Gateware](./gateware/index.md) documentation details all of the Amaranth HDL elaboratables and support code needed to integrate SCSI into your own Amaranth based project.

The [Python](./python/index.md) documentation details all of the modules and support code for dealing with SCSI traffic on the host side, allow you to build python scripts that can interact with SCSI devices easily.
