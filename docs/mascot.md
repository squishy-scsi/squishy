## About

Sachi (さち, 幸, means happiness) is a spirit fox who attaches to an old magnetic tape drive. She loves to fiddle with old technology. Sachi used to be the divine agent of a small Shinto shrine called Suka Jinja (素華神社).

She was known for helping the locals with her wisdom in the past. Nowadays her shrine has been built over by a university, and she assumes her human identity as Professor Suka Sachiko (須賀 早智子) and teaches Japanese History and Computer Science there.
